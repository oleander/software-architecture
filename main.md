## Why Github

Github in a software achitecture point of view is very interesting due to its modularity. The platform is devided into many diffrent moduals where most of them are open sourced. An open code base like Github has been adjusted to be reviewd by people other then the main developers. This means that it should be fairly easy to analyze the project for this course.
