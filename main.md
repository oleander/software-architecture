## What's Github

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects. As of May 2011, GitHub was the most popular open source code repository site.

GitHub Inc. was founded in 2008 and is based in San Francisco, California.

### Building blocks

GitHub constists of a web application and a variety of server side services.

## Market

It's quite difficult to messure market share when it comes to the different avalible platforms. The major ones are Sourceforge, Google Code, CodePlex and Github. One measurement to try to evalute the amount of *active* users is to look at the total amount of published commits.

As of June 2nd, 2011 Github had 1,153,059 commits, Sourceforge had 624,989, Google Code 287,901 and CodePlex 49,839.

## History

In a talk at Yahoo! headquarters on 24 February 2009, GitHub team members announced that during the first year that GitHub was online, it accumulated 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of them in the previous month alone. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once and 4,600 merged. On 5 July 2009, a Github Blog post announced they reached the 100,000 users mark.

## Why Github

Github in a software achitecture point of view is very interesting due to its modularity. The platform is devided into many diffrent moduals where most of them are open sourced. An open code base like Github has been adjusted to be reviewed by people other then the main developers. This means that it should be fairly easy to analyze the project for this course.
